A reading tracker built with React, Typescript, and Material UI.

## MVP To-do:
CRUD operations
- [x] Create entries for current, finished, and TBR lists
- [ ] Update
  - [ ] edit book details
  - [ ] update reading progress 
  - [ ] transfer entries between lists 
- [ ] Delete an entry

UI stuff
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Display book covers
- [ ] Show rating within entries as stars

## Post MVP ideas:
- User can set a monthly or yearly reading goal
- Allow user to capture extra details, such as custom tags and commentary
- Filtering/sorting for lists (like filter by rating and tag, or sort asc/desc by date) 
- When people update their reading progress, they can optionally write a comment. 
  - Each progress update can be represented as an entry on a timeline, that is toggleable for each book.
- A statistics page that gives details about stuff like pages read, most read genres, etc.
  - Could include calendar view denoting books and # of pages read? Similar to github contribution chart
- Option for users to fill out book data manually (if not found in API)
- Dark mode
